Hi, my name is Tarek and I’m an aspiring data scientist and AI engineer.  

I hold a Bachelor’s degree in economics (Business, Economics and Social Sciences; WU Wien) 
with a focus on data science and finance and a strong emphasis on programming.
I would like to help you by analyzing and visualizing data to support the business decision making process.
Also, I have a passion for MLOps and am a certified Google Cloud engineer.

Please take a look at my [Blog](https://tadonker.github.io/blog/) or my [Bachelor Thesis](/assets/docs/Thesis_TarekDonker.pdf) on transformers for time series forecasting.

My newest [Project](https://projectberlinvision.ey.r.appspot.com/) is hosted on Google Cloud and combines image classification and ChatGPT.
