Hi, my name is Tarek and I’m an aspiring data scientist.  

I hold a Bachelor’s degree in economics (Business, Economics and Social Sciences; WU Wien) 
with a focus on data science and finance and a strong emphasis on programming.
I would like to help you by analyzing and visualizing data to support the business decision making process.
Please take a look at my projects or my [Bachelor Thesis](/assets/docs/Thesis_TarekDonker.pdf) on transformers for time series forecasting.
